## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced TFT Features

Our implementation extends the standard TFT with several explainability features:

```python
class ExplainableTFT(TemporalFusionTransformer):
    def forward_with_explanations(self, x, return_attention=True):
        # Captures intermediate layer outputs
        # Returns detailed explanations for each processing step
        # Enables layer-by-layer visualization
```

### Layer-by-Layer Analysis

Each prediction passes through the following stages:

1. **Input Processing**: Raw features â†’ Embedded representations
2. **Variable Selection**: Feature filtering and importance weighting  
3. **LSTM Processing**: Temporal encoding/decoding
4. **Attention Mechanism**: Temporal focus computation
5. **Feed Forward Networks**: Non-linear transformations
6. **Output Generation**: Quantile predictions

### Visualization Components

- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual model structure with data flow
- **Attention Heatmaps**: Temporal attention weight visualization
- **Feature Importance**: Variable selection weight analysis
